# ValorantWiki

This project's aim is simply to be an interactive way of navigating through Valorant info using the game's public api (https://valorant-api.com/). Therefore, the core concerns are with design, eficiency and responsiveness. I tried to achieve this making the most I could of RxJS and Angular 16 features.
